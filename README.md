# Real-time-Digit-Classifier

This project implements a real-time digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits (0-9) from hand-written images captured from a webcam feed in real time.

## Features
- Real-time digit classification using a webcam.
- Utilizes a CNN model trained on the MNIST dataset.
- Predicts digits as the user writes them or displays them in front of the camera.
- Built with Python and OpenCV for real-time webcam interaction.
